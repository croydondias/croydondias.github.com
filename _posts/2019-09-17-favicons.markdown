I use [Voxi][voxi] as my mobile provider. Interestingly enough, they don't have a native mobile app for support. Instead they use a webapp that you can pin to your homescreen (atleast on iOS).

After a bit of googling, and digging through the page-source for their main website, I learnt about [this feature in more detail][webclip]. With a bit of help from [iconifier.net][iconifier] I managed to add similar support for this website. Go on.. give it a try.
