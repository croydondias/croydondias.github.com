This blog is hosted on [Netlify][netlify] with the source code stored in [Github][gh]. The blog is generated using [Jekyll][jekyll] and all posts are written in Markdown. I hope to post some tech findings, personal musings, and spend hours trying to get the CSS _just_ right (eventually give up and pick up an off the shelf theme).

### Next steps
While browsing around the internet looking for how others have organised their Jekyll blogs (and also to find answers to some UI quirks), I found out that Jekyll also has a [thriving plugin ecosystem][jekyll-plugins]. Below are some of the plugins that I'd like to integrate in future.

- [Algolia](https://github.com/algolia/jekyll-algolia) - Adds full site search capabilites to a static website
- [Paginate](https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2) - Allows for pagination (Definitely require this once I have more content on the blog :blush:)
- [jemoji](https://github.com/jekyll/jemoji) - Do I even need to state why? :bowtie:
